Wagtail product
Principal Interaction Designer
I help people have a great time using digital interfaces.
I've been solving design challenges for charities and nonprofits for over 15 years. I spearheaded the Torchbox Bristol wing in 2013 having joined originally in 2004, and it's been lovely to see it grow beyond 30 people.
I have designed websites for the likes of
Oxfam GB
,
NASA JPL
, University of Oxford,
Museum of London
& California College of Arts.
I did the original design for
Wagtail CMS
, and continue to play a lead role improving the experience of it's ever-evolving UI.
I love prototyping in code to explore the interactive and fluid nature of digital products.
Outside of work I'm passionate about food, and few things get me more excited than cooking a chilli. I also enjoy mixing Drum n Bass, brewing beer (preferably with my brother and dad) and curry-offs with pals.
