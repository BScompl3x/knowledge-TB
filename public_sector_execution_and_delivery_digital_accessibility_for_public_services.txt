We can help you create compliant, inclusive digital experiences that serve all users effectively.

Accessibility testing, audits, strategy and monitoring are worthless if you can’t make the recommended changes to your websites and services.
Too many organisations have too long a delay between running accessibility audits, and actually implementing the recommendations. Our expert accessibility developers don’t just run audits to find and report issues, but they will also work with you to proactively provide fixes and build the accessible code which will improve your users’ experiences.
View our remediation services
A combination of manual and automated monitoring of your websites and services can make sure that any emerging accessibility issues can be resolved without impacting your users.
Over time, as websites and digital services evolve and develop, accessibility issues can creep in. Our team will use established automated tools and a programme of regular manual monitoring to identify issues, suggest fixes, maintain your levels of digital accessibility and mitigate the risk of impact to your users.

Our website is our ‘shop window’ for people seeking advice, information and support so it’s absolutely vital that it’s accessible, intuitive and user-friendly. From the start of our work with Torchbox, inclusive design and accessibility have been the driving force. From feedback on the designs to user testing the site to ensure it is accessible and intuitive, blind and partially sighted people have played an invaluable role in developing the website.
