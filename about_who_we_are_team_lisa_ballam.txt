Head of Marketing
My job is to make sure the world knows about Torchbox and all we have to offer! From the projects we deliver and the awesome clients that we work with - to the fantastic and supportive culture that we have internally. I'm also proud to be an Employee Trustee Director.
I gather useful content and organise events for the nonprofit and public sector, to help organisations to implement change that will future-proof their long term impact.
Our events bring together people in the sector to discuss current topics and challenges, such as our digital innovation breakfast series with guest speakers from the charity sector; our quarterly What's New in Wagtail webinar, where we share new features with the community, and host frequent digital marketing webinars, where we share actionable tips and advice for nonprofits.
Outside of work, I’m partial to a Friday night kitchen disco with my husband Matt and two little boys, and I love a good run on a Saturday morning (but not if we’ve had a kitchen disco the night before!).
