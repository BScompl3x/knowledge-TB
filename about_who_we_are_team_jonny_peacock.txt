Jonny Peacock
Design & Innovation
Senior Service Designer
I help clients to understand their users and guide them in their digital decision making through various user research techniques.
At Torchbox I've worked with clients including Oxfam,
GOV.UK
,
Wharton Interactive
and the
Royal College of Art
.
Most of my work is done in user research-focused discovery sprints. These help us get clarity about an organisation and their users, and start to work on information architecture problems.
I care about designing solutions that fit together as a whole, that are easy to use, and that work well, right down to the last detail. And I love being able to do that for clients who strive to make the world a better place!
To me, it's important for UX specialists to have a broad set of skills and experiences. Before working at Torchbox I've had roles in edtech, copywriting and account management, and studied computer science at university.
In my spare time I enjoy baked goods, playing music, learning new things and playing video games.
