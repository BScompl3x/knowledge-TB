Scale impact through technology
Digital and AI solutions that scale social good
Technology, including AI, is transforming how people access support, engage with causes, and deliver services more effectively.
Yet many organisations struggle with legacy systems, digital skills gaps, and making the most of emerging tech.
Working with leading charities like RNIB, Samaritans, and Mind, we can help you harness digital and AI innovation to create lasting social change while building internal capabilities.
Chart your digital future
Where can technology take you?
Develop winning digital and AI strategies that bring stakeholders along, addressing ethical implications head-on with our deep understanding of charity funding and governance.
Create life-changing services
Transform how you support people.
Design and build services that extend reach - from Samaritans' web chat service to RNIB's AI-powered helpline that's making support more accessible while maintaining trust.
Modernise your tech
Future-proof your organisation.
We'll help you select and implement the right tech, migrate to the cloud, and integrate your systems - ready to scale with your ambitions.
Transform your digital presence
Stand out online and inspire action.
Create conversion-optimised, accessible websites that showcase your impact - just like we have for Samaritans, RNIB and Oxfam.
Diversify income streams
Transform your fundraising.
Build innovative giving experiences and optimise donation journeys - delivering reliable income growth for your mission.
Protect your users and data
Don't let cyber attacks affect your charity.
Implement robust security measures and governance - because in our sector, a breach isn't just an incident, it's a betrayal of trust.
Let's amplify your impact
Speak to our team about strengthening your technology, implementing ethical AI solutions, and creating lasting positive change.
