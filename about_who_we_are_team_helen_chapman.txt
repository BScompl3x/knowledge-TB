Helen Chapman
Development
Senior Engineer
I help our clients create beautiful and user-friendly websites, and most importantly, I make sure that the people I manage have everything they need to do the same. I have over 20 years of experience working in the digital sector, and bring a careful and thorough approach to everything I do.
I've worked with many amazing organisations during my time at Torchbox, from the World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace and Oxford University to Great Ormond Street Hospital, Sue Ryder and The National Archives. Knowing that I am helping to make the world a better place by working with these organisations is what gets me out of bed in the morning and keeps me motivated.
I'm currently getting out of my front-end comfort zone and learning back-end skills in order to be able to confidently tech lead on new projects.
I have two lovely boys who are growing up fast and they are my main focus outside work. But I also enjoy walking and running in the countryside, gardening, reading novels and (geekily) doing the Saturday Guardian cryptic crossword. I am a member of two choirs, and in the past, I have also helped children learn to code by volunteering as a code club leader at my local primary school.
