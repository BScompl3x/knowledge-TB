Building a more sustainable and accessible Torchbox website

Last year I had the pleasure of tech-leading a rebrand and rebuild of our own website. It was a great opportunity to make our site a beacon of best practices for both
accessibility
and
sustainability
. Having spent many years advising clients in these areas, it felt important to show how thoughtful technical choices can create a site that's both visually engaging and environmentally responsible. This project gave us the chance to demonstrate these principles in action and measure their real-world impact.
Sustainability
Our initial
sustainability audit
highlighted several areas where we could make improvements, particularly around image handling and file sizes. After attending an eye-opening talk about digital sustainability a couple of years ago, I learned that the digital industry's carbon emissions are now higher than those of the aviation sector – something that really drives home the need for more sustainable web development practices.
We implemented several technical improvements to make the site more sustainable:
Serving the website in dark mode by default - research has shown that bright, white websites consume significantly more energy on user devices
Converting images to WebP format, which creates much smaller files than traditional PNGs and JPEGs
Using responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes - meaning a mobile user won't need to download the same huge image file as someone viewing on a 4K monitor
Adding lazy loading for images below the fold, so they only load when needed rather than automatically
Avoiding images that fill the full width of the viewport, which require large file sizes
Only loading YouTube videos when users choose to play them, rather than loading them automatically
Paginating our team page to only load 20 images per page
After launching the new site, we ran an audit of it
through Shadowbox, our sustainability testing tool
. With the new design and WebP image format, the average amount of image data loaded per page was reduced by 78%. By asking users before loading YouTube videos, initial page load emissions were cut by over 50% for pages with videos. Overall, the audit found that the median page size of the site decreased by 38%. With less data transferred over the network, the new website pages are loading faster and have a smaller environmental impact.
Accessibility
It’s always good to remember that by following accessibility standards, we improve the user experience for everyone, not just users with particular needs. A new mum with only one hand free will appreciate good keyboard navigation, or a middle-aged person like me will appreciate being able to quickly zoom to read text when they’ve left their glasses in another room.
With this project, we made sure to consider accessibility from the very beginning, rather than treating it as a final check or scrambling to fix issues near to launch. This meant baking
accessibility testing
into our design and development processes from day one. For every component we built, we ran through a comprehensive set of checks including:
Designing with accessibility in mind, and ensuring all designs were reviewed for accessibility before they were built
Automated testing with the Axe developer plugin
Keyboard navigation tests
Ensuring that all focus states for links and buttons are visible
Testing with different font sizes from the browser settings
Testing with different zoom levels
Testing with a screen reader
High contrast mode testing
Ensuring all animations are turned off for users who prefer reduced motion
Challenges
Image processing turned out to be one of our biggest technical hurdles. One tricky area was getting WebP conversion working smoothly in Wagtail CMS, particularly when generating different image sizes for various screen resolutions. The server would often crash when trying to process certain files, which taught us an important lesson about handling animated GIFs - we solved this by switching to more efficient video formats.
We also tested automatically reducing image saturation to decrease file sizes, but quickly found this didn't work well with our people-focused imagery which features a lot in our blogs and case studies.
Looking ahead
To ensure these improvements keep working as intended, we've set up monitoring with DebugBear to track performance and page load times. We also run weekly accessibility checks through Browserstack, which helps us catch any issues quickly – whether they're in the content or the code.
We've now got a solid set of best practices in place for all future development on the site which is currently underway as part of our latest iteration - more info on that soon!
Final thoughts
Through this project, I've seen first-hand how small optimisations can add up to make a real difference. Every kilobyte we shave off an image file size adds up when you consider it is saved every single time it is requested. Small changes have a massive impact over time. But perhaps most importantly, I've reflected on how making websites more sustainable and accessible isn't about dramatic overhauls - it's about thoughtful choices at every step of the build process. Making the internet more accessible and sustainable is something we should all be striving for because better practices mean a better experience for everyone.
