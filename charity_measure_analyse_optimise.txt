Measure, analyse & optimise
Make your data work harder for your mission
Charities face pressure to prove impact, optimise digital experiences and make data-driven decisions. Yet many struggle with fragmented data, complex analytics tools and measuring what matters.
With experience working with charities like Oxfam GB, Samaritans, Mind and DEC, we can build the frameworks, skills and tools to turn your data into actionable insights that drive real change.

Personally, I'm over the moon with what we've achieved here; I think we took a calculated risk, but in doing so we've proven irrefutably that we can make an impact, and this is the buy-in I need to move the conversation forward towards defining a fully fledged experimentation program at Mind. So thanks again and I look forward to building on this success!
