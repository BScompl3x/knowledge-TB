Chief Innovation Officer
I co-founded Torchbox more than 20 years ago and spent much of that time leading our design work and running the business as Creative Director and Managing Director. Today, as Chief Innovation Officer, I’m focused on what’s next.
My role is to lead the development of new products and services that will define Torchbox’s next chapter. I’m focused on innovation that responds directly to the challenges our clients face—and on turning emerging technologies, especially AI, into powerful tools for solving them. While AI is rightly raising questions, it also opens up transformative possibilities. Our job is to explore that potential on behalf of the positive changemakers we work with—helping them do more good, more effectively, with the right tools for what comes next.
I live in an Oxfordshire village. I'm married with two teenage children (and one 20-year-old!). I'm a frustrated flatlander (craving mountains) and I love sporty, outdoorsy stuff (backcountry skiing, squash, off-road cycling, golf, cricket in that sort of order).
I am a Board Director of Torchbox Ltd and a Founder Trustee Director of Torchbox Trustees Limited.
