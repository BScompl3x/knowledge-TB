Product & Delivery Management
Client Partner (Public Sector)
Iâ€™m passionate about ensuring our clients get the most from their time partnering with Torchbox. I work to ensure we operate as a unified team to create products that deliver real impact, whilst helping our clients to achieve their organisational goals that make a huge difference to the lives of the people they serve.
In my time at Torchbox, I've enjoyed doing that with all kinds of nonprofit clients, particularly those in healthcare, and arts and culture. Recently, it's been a privilege to work alongside the team at
Children's Health Ireland
to consolidate five existing sites into one, as well as working with the
London Museum
on their brand new site that's looking to get the world talking about their incredible collection.
I'm also one of the Employee Trustee Directors at Torchbox, and I'm passionate about all things employee ownership.
Outside of work, I'm married with two young boys who are starting to enjoy some of the things I'm excited about too. Whether it's playing with balls, being in the garden, getting stuck in with our local church, following QPR or spending time by the sea!
