Lily Veale
Operations
Senior Marketing Executive
My role involves producing creative content that showcases our expert team, client solutions, and people-first culture at Torchbox. From social media and event planning - to email marketing and copywriting, my role is always varied and exciting.
I’ve worked in Marketing for the past seven years and always aim to bring finesse and flair to my work. Building on the established Torchbox brand, I am growing an engaged community from within the third sector by sharing our story, knowledge and services through innovative campaigns and social media content.
I particularly love creating content that inspires young professionals, regularly writing to my personal LinkedIn page with Marketing advice and tips. Recently, I've been working with the team at Torchbox to help them tell their stories through LinkedIn too. We've seen some brilliant articles, case studies, and content over the past year!
I'm also a member of the Torchbox Wellbeing Voice Group, supporting our people with initiatives to take care of their mental health and wellbeing, and removing the taboo of having these conversations in the workplace.
During my downtime, I love to try out the best food and drink spots in Bristol. I also enjoy hiking, travelling and listening to music - you’ll usually find me listening to Chris Stapleton, Johnny Cash or Sam Fender.
