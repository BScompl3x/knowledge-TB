Development
Principal Engineer (Charity Sector), Trustee Director
As a tech lead and architect, I oversee some of our largest projects to ensure their technical success with ten years of multi-agency experience using Wagtail CMS.
I'm also incredibly proud to be an Employee Trustee Director, Mental Health First Responder, and line manager/mentor to three amazing people.
I've helped create a Django/React design system for NCBI, built a new international trade service for GOV.UK, and managed high-traffic crime maps for the Home Office. Part of my role is to train teams to build technical capabilities/capacity through staff augmentation.
As an accessibility advocate, I believe everyone should have the same opportunities and all humans deserve equal access to information and services - equality helps us all progress.
Currently, I'm working on projects using
headless Wagtail
, GraphQL, Next.js, and Storybook.
Outside work, I encourage misadventures in the pub, enjoy long hikes and muddy runs, and
love
playing board games.
