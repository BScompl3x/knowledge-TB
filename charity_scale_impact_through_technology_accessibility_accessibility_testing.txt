Accessibility testing
Poor accessibility excludes millions and risks legal compliance. Our specialists identify critical barriers and provide clear, actionable advice to make your website work for everyone. We've helped RNIB, Internet Society, and other major charities achieve WCAG compliance and boost user engagement.
Automated testing
Using automated tools to quickly test for a wide range of likely accessibility issues. We can then separate site-wide template problems, and one-off content issues.
Manual testing
Our accessibility experts will test a selection of pages with a range of assistive technologies adapted to your site’s audience, and report WCAG compliance issues as well as accessibility or UX improvements.
Design review
Our UX and design teams provide actionable recommendations for any user experience or visual design deliverable.: brand guidelines, UI mockups, user journey maps, etc.
Code review
We can leverage our technology expertise to provide accessibility recommendations tailored to your site’s platform and team workflow.

Our website is our ‘shop window’ for people seeking advice, information and support so it’s absolutely vital that it’s accessible, intuitive and user-friendly. From the start of our work with Torchbox, inclusive design and accessibility have been the driving force. From feedback on the designs to user testing the site to ensure it is accessible and intuitive, blind and partially sighted people have played an invaluable role in developing the website.

The Audit was very comprehensive and resourceful, including recommendations to fix issues, references on tools used and related WCAG criteria, readability and usability scores for content pieces. Based on the audit, we mapped out the plan for implementing the fixes and we are actively working toward ensuring that more pages on our site are fully accessible.
