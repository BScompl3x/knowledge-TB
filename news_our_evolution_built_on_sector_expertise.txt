We've just launched our refreshed Torchbox.com website, but this change goes much deeper than visuals. It reflects a fundamental shift in how we're structured to serve you better - putting sector expertise at the heart of everything we do.
Why deep sector expertise matters
Over the years, we've seen first-hand how digital success hinges on truly understanding the unique landscape our clients operate in.
The challenges facing a charity fundraising team are worlds apart from those of a public sector service director. Different goals, different constraints, different measures of success.
That's why we've reshaped Torchbox around three distinct sector offerings:
End-to-end measurable digital solutions for charities
Digital service & innovation for the Public Sector and partners
Specialised Wagtail CMS services
This isn't a new direction so much as a sharper focus on what's always made us effective - our commitment to understanding your world inside out.
Beyond the traditional agency
We're moving away from the typical agency structure to create three specialised business units:
Charity
: Strategic problem-solvers offering end-to-end solutions that address priority needs, building on our 25 years of experience in this space.
Public
: A challenger approach navigating complex challenges creatively.
Wagtail CMS services
: We know Wagtail inside out, and our specialist services can help you get the most out of it.
From services to solutions
This strategic shift changes how we approach our work. Instead of leading with technical capabilities, we're now focusing on the outcomes we help you achieve.
For charities, this means end-to-end measurable digital solutions that deliver tangible impact. For public sector teams, it means progressive digital services that drive systemic change. For Wagtail users, it means expert support to max the potential of the platform.
A website that reflects our specialised approach
When you visit Torchbox.com, you'll notice we now invite you to choose your journey based on your sector—Charity, Public Sector, or Wagtail services.
Each section has its own navigation, content and visual identity while still feeling unmistakably Torchbox. This structure allows us to speak directly to the specific challenges you're facing in your world.
Instead of generic service descriptions, you'll find focused solutions that address the real problems you're trying to solve—whether that's maximising fundraising impact, delivering progressive public services, or getting the most from your Wagtail implementation.
Looking ahead
We're excited about where this new sector-focused approach will take us—and the impact we can create together with our clients. By leaning into our specialised expertise, we believe we can deliver even more value and help you navigate the unique digital challenges in your space.
